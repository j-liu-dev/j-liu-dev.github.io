You aren't looking to hire the work, but the person who made it.

### Finger-pointing
<small>(between the team members)</small>  
What I would fight to the death against!

### Honesty
I strive to be the very incarnation of it.

### File Structure
I am very sensitive to it and eager to do anything to make it better.  
Often times, it could decide whether I go dancing to my desk in the morning OR zombie-walk to it with this â†“ face.

### Code Quality
Of course and needless to say...

### Micro-management
I find myself really slumping under it.  
On one occasion, I had a project manager who would ask every other hour
> How's it going?  
I wasn't able to keep my calm and concentrate on the tasks at hand. I am not blaming his management style, but it surely is not my favorite.

### Responsibility
I thrive when empowered.  
It doesn't necessarily have to be the project manager or team lead. A good sense of responsibility keeps me high and motivated.

### Promises
A man of his words - I dare to describe me as such.  

### Feedback
While in the _zone_, I never take feedback personally.  
I rather encourage my teammates to give it often. And I give it often.

### Life-long Learner
I am a book-worm. I am a fast learner.

### Motivated
Programming is the profession of my own choice. I love it by heart.  
However, when I even love the project I work on, the motivation doubles.  
If you are reading this, it means I am quite into your project or your team. Yes, I only apply when I find the project/team exciting.

### Challenges & Creativeness
I thrive in a challenging and creative environment.  
Especially true when I am surrounded by awesome & supportive teammates.

### I've got your back
Towards my teammates and clients.  
When you have an urgent task to tackle immediately, I will be there.  
When you have a difficult issue to solve, I will be there.  
Personally, **I've got your back** was the sweetest word I've ever heard from my teammates.

### I don't agree with you
Yes, I can say it.  
I know you wouldn't fire me for it.  
Whenever I have suggestions, even if they are different from your perspective, I openly communicate so it could serve the purpose of making our product better.

### Weakness
I sometimes find myself too much obsessed with one task.  
Especially, when I am dealing with a bug, it is even more difficult to get out of it.

I am healing from this weakness by nurturing my ability to _switch and prioritize between the tasks without feeling guilty_.

<hr>

So far describes me from my personal outlook.  
ATM, my personal project is equipping myself with the world-class self-discipline.
