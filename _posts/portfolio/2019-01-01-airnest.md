### Team

Airnest, now a part of <a href="http://www.measure.com" target="_blank">Measure.com</a>, was in need of a front-end developer who could build the complex UI/UX of their Drone Management System.    
Over time, I also took part in the back-end development, especially for the counter-parts of the front-end blocks I built.  

### Contributions

#### Airnest successfully acquired by Measure.com at higher value!

Besides the general-purpose reports and data tables, I made 2 significant contributions to the project.  
First off, I envisioned and built a Flight History Simulator which included self-made Altitude Meter.  
Secondly, I brought Flight Area Planner into realization, using MapBox.

On the back-end, in collaboration with the drone expert, I wrote Flight Log Parser that transformed some raw drone log files into consumable PostgreSQL records.

### Challenges

In this project, the challenges were attributable to the pursuit of optimal user experience.

- How to keep the parsing time of drone logs from blocking the user's simultaneous activities.
The solution was rather simple, I employed Rails worker to do the job in the background.

- The ways to enable users to use the Flight History Simulator without any prior training. After intensive brain-storming and surfing online for some insights, I made it resemble after the Youtube video player. No single user reported confusion with the simulator ever since.

- Flight Area Planner, where I had to enable the drawing of a circle area both on 2D and 3D versions of the map.
I had a go with the traditional way of doing it all by myself and realized that it'd take me nowhere.
I asked the project lead, Justin, about the track drawing module of their iPad app. I picked the algorithm of breaking curves down to the lines and elaborated from there.

### Accomplishments, My lesson

Needless to say, I got a level up in React dev tools and Ruby on Rails serializers.  
Also, I learned how to delegate effectively and make use of existing resources to my advantages.

Another refreshing experience taught me that I need some fresh distractions from time to time.  
Back to the story of Flight History Simulator - I couldn't have made it in time if I had been staring at the code-base for hours. My decision to let go and switch to my personal hobby of video editing gave me the aha moment.
