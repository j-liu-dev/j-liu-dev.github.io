I"Õ<p>I worked for 4 startups, as a full-time employee for 3 of them, and a contractor for the other.</p>

<p>During the process, I taught myself to be creative, innovative and entrepreneurial while delivering what is expected from me - the high-quality software.</p>

<p>Some of my significant contributions are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>helping a gaming startup increase the <strong>annual revenue by 8.9%</strong></li>
  <li>helping an AI startup land <strong>2 rounds of venture funding</strong></li>
  <li>helping a drone-tech startup <strong>sell their business</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I engage in my daily endeavors with passion and share the ambition of the team making an impact on peopleâ€™s lives. This makes me a self-initiator.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People who are passionate can be trained in everything. But we donâ€™t know how to train in attitude.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I strongly believe in the above quote, and I personally experienced it while working at startups.<br />
I work hard, be part of the team, and am willing to take challenges as the founders do.</p>

<hr />
<hr />
<p>Fully understanding the startup life, I am ready to jump in and make things right, and very accustomed to wearing many hats whenever needed.</p>

<p>Things that I take seriously while working at startups are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>sticking to and living by the company value</li>
  <li>getting to know the team culture and being a happy part of it</li>
  <li>open communication and welcoming constructive criticism</li>
</ul>

<p>The strongest personal trait of mine is self-discipline. It breeds many of my positive work ethics.<br />
Everyday is my struggle to build world-class self-discipline. You can try <a href="https://30daysofdiscipline.com">30 days of discipline</a> too.</p>

<p>I want to see myself join you in your startup journey and make difference.<br />
Until then, take care.</p>
