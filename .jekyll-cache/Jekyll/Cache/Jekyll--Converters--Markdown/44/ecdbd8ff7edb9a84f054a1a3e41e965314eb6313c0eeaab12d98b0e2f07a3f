I"¨<p>While working at <a href="http://www.sigsensetech.com" target="_blank">Sigsense Technologies</a>, I was badly stuck with unseen customization of Highcharts graph.</p>

<p><img src="/img/portfolio/sigsense_machine_learning.png" alt="Machine Learning UI" /></p>

<p>Highcharts graph needed to be made bi-directional, which meant end-users being able to draw different types of plots using their mouse.<br />
In addition, already-drawn plots were to be resized by the end-usersâ€™ dragging of the plot edges. (you could notice the colorful pillars from the above figure)<br />
Given the primary purpose of Highcharts, it implied heavy customization and an elaborate manipulation of the available interfaces to the graph.</p>

<p>Google it! That was my first response to this challenge.<br />
It was not very successful, as there were no such use cases discussed or answered publicly.<br />
So there came the realization -</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I need the <strong>top-down approach</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hereâ€™s how I broke the issue down to smaller pieces.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, the challenge boiled down to resolving 3 <strong><abbr title="the green ones on the above figure">leaf issues</abbr></strong> :</p>
<ul>
  <li>Catch mouse events on Highcharts canvas</li>
  <li>Add plots after the graph is rendered</li>
  <li>Remove plots after the graph is rendered</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>Then, with the issue broken down to tangible, atomic and easy-to-solve pieces, I did the dreaded and contributed to the original value of the product.</p>
