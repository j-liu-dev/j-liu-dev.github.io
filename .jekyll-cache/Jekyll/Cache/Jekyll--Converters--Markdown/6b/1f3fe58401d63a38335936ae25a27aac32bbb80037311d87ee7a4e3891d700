<p>Airnest, now a part of <a href="http://www.measure.com" target="_blank">Measure.com</a>, was in need of a front-end developer who could build the complex UI/UX of their Drone Management System.  <br />
Over time, I also took part in the back-end development, especially for the counter-parts of the front-end blocks I built.</p>

<h4 id="airnest-got-acquired-at-a-high-value">Airnest got acquired at a high value!</h4>

<p>Besides the general-purpose reports and data tables, I made 2 significant contributions to the project.<br />
First off, I envisioned and built a Flight History Simulator which included self-made Altitude Meter.<br />
Secondly, I brought Flight Area Planner into realization, using MapBox.</p>

<p>On the back-end, in collaboration with the drone expert, I wrote Flight Log Parser that transformed some raw drone log files into consumable MongoDB records.</p>

<h3 id="challenges">Challenges</h3>

<p>In this project, the challenges were attributable to the pursuit of optimal user experience.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>How to keep the parsing time of drone logs from blocking the user’s simultaneous activities.
The solution was rather simple, I employed Rails worker to do the job in the background.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ways to enable users to use the Flight History Simulator without any prior training. After intensive brain-storming and surfing online for some insights, I made it resemble after the Youtube video player. No single user reported confusion with the simulator ever since.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Flight Area Planner, where I had to enable the drawing of a circle area both on 2D and 3D versions of the map.
I had a go with the traditional way of doing it all by myself and realized that it’d take me nowhere.
I asked the project lead, Justin, about the track drawing module of their iPad app. I picked the algorithm of breaking curves down to the lines and elaborated from there.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Starting the 2nd year at Airnest (2017), I made a focus shift from conventional Web development to mobile app development.<br />
I took the lead in</p>
<ul>
  <li>Refactoring the already existing iOS application</li>
  <li>Developing the Android counterpart from the scratch</li>
</ul>

<p>A critical decision was to be made between <strong>Native solutions</strong> and <strong>Hybrid solution</strong>.
Though React Native was relatively new in the field, I saw a huge potential of productivity and maintainability in it.<br />
Some justifications made were</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cost and time effective by building a cross-platform mobile application</li>
  <li>Substantial reuse of the Web application’s building blocks (built with React)</li>
</ul>

<p>Adopting React Native was a strategic decision that implied a certain degree of risk.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Facebook’s long term commitment to React Native being not clear</li>
  <li>The Patent Rights of the platform being slightly unclear</li>
</ul>

<p>At that time, Airnest was in <abbr title="Mergers and Acquisitions">M &amp; A</abbr> talks with Measure.com whose focus of the evaluation was in the potential of growth of the customer base. They had already verified the value of what Airnest offered.<br />
As for the nature of the application, support of the mobile platforms became the decisive factor in the expansion of the customer base. And it had to be done before the evaluation ended.</p>

<p>We took the risk, took the advantage of React Native, and hit our goal of <strong>Cross-platform support</strong> and <strong>Delivering fast</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="accomplishments-my-lesson">Accomplishments, My lesson</h3>

<p>Needless to say, I got a level up in React dev tools and Ruby on Rails serializers.<br />
Also, I learned how to delegate effectively and make use of existing resources to my advantages.</p>

<p>Another refreshing experience taught me that I need some fresh distractions from time to time.<br />
Back to the story of Flight History Simulator - I couldn’t have made it in time if I had been staring at the code-base for hours. My decision to let go and switch to my personal hobby of video editing gave me the aha moment.</p>

<p>Regarding the React Native campaign, I learned by heart that</p>

  <p>You can’t be successful in business without taking risks</p>
